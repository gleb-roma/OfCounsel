"ACT as a corporate attorney whose job is to check the compliance of the company's policy with the state's new laws.

Your task is to identify is the provided policy complies with the new law.

If the policy complies with the new law, then say so and do nothing more.

Otherwise, if the policy does not comply with the law, make a general assessment how bad is the violation, and make a numbered list of what is missing from the policy or what is wrong with the policy, prioritizing the most important issues first. Note on the general assessment: direct violations of the law make the non-compliance severe, i.e. the policy be non-compliant; innocuous missing information make the compliance less severe; no violations make the policy fully compliant.

Note on time limits: if the policy promises shorter times to react or respond to something than the law requires, eg within 30 days vs 45 days required, it is NOT a violation, since sooner is better. 

For example, if the policy is ""The company's address is 123 Main Street, New York, NY 10001. The company's phone number is 212-555-1234."" and the new law is ""You have to specify the company's address, phone number, and email address."", then the missing part is ""company's email"".""

As another example, if the policy is ""the company will respond to a verifiable consumer request within 30 days of its receipt"" and the law is ""the company is required to respond within 45 days of receiving a verifiable consumer request"", then there are no missing parts and the policy is fully compliant.

_Verifiable Consumer Requests_

To exercise your rights described above, please email us at support@recroom.com with the subject line ""CCPA"". Only you, or someone legally authorized to act on your behalf, may make a verifiable consumer request related to your Personal Information. You may also make a verifiable consumer request on behalf of your Child. You may only make a verifiable consumer request for access or data portability twice within a 12-month period. The verifiable consumer request must:

- Provide sufficient information that allows us to reasonably verify you are the person about whom we collected Personal Information or an authorized representative.
- Describe your request with sufficient detail that allows us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it.

We cannot respond to your request or provide you with Personal Information if we cannot verify your identity or authority to make the request and confirm that the Personal Information relates to you. Making a verifiable consumer request does not require you to create an account with us. We will only use Personal Information provided in a verifiable consumer request to verify your identity or authority to make the request.

_Response Timing and Format_

We endeavor to respond to a verifiable consumer request within 30 days of its receipt. If we require more time, we will inform you of the reason and extension period in writing. If you have an account with us, we will deliver our written response to that account. If you do not have an account with us, we will deliver our written response by mail or electronically, at your option.

Any disclosures we provide will only cover the 12-month period preceding the receipt of verifiable consumer request. The response we provide will also explain the reasons we cannot comply with a request, if applicable.

For data portability requests, we will select a format to provide your Personal Information that is readily useable and should allow you to transmit the information from one entity to another entity without hindrance.

We do not charge a fee to process or respond to your verifiable consumer request unless it is excessive, repetitive, or manifestly unfounded. If we determine that the request warrants a fee, we will tell you why we made that decision and provide you with a cost estimate before completing your request.

"ACT as a corporate attorney whose job is to check the compliance of the company's policy with the state's new laws.

Your task is to identify if the provided policy section complies with the new law.

If the policy section complies with the new law, then say so and do nothing more.

Otherwise, if the policy section does not comply with the law, make a general assessment how bad is the violation, and make a numbered list of what is missing from the policy or what is wrong with the policy, prioritizing the most important issues first. Make sure to mention the name and/or the number of the policy section you are assessing.

Note on time limits: if the policy promises shorter times to react or respond to something than the law requires, eg the company responds within 30 days while 45 days is required by law, it is NOT a violation since sooner is better, and 30 is less than 45.

For example, if the policy is ""The company's address is 123 Main Street, New York, NY 10001. The company's phone number is 212-555-1234."" and the new law is ""You have to specify the company's address, phone number, and email address."", then the missing part is ""company's email"", and so the policy is not fully compliant.

As another example, if the entire policy is ""The company may collect the following types of personal information: name, address, phone number, email address, and credit card number."" and the new law is ""You have to specify a mechanism for consumers to delete their personal information."", then the missing part is ""mechanism for consumers to delete their personal information"", and so the policy is not fully compliant.

As another example, if the policy is ""the company will respond to a verifiable consumer request within 30 days of its receipt"" and the law is ""the company is required to respond within 45 days of receiving a verifiable consumer request"", then the policy is fully compliant because 30 is less than 45.

  ""answer"": ""The policy section '# 9. Additional Notice for California Residents' is generally compliant with the new law. However, there are a few areas that need to be addressed to ensure full compliance:

1. The policy does not explicitly mention the obligation to inform all individuals responsible for handling consumer inquiries about the businessโs privacy practices or the businessโs compliance with the title, as required by Sections 1798.130.202012_a_3_B_iii_5_C_ii_6 and 1798.135.202013_c_3 of the legal code. This is a significant omission and should be addressed immediately.

2. The policy does not clearly state that the company will disclose and deliver the required information to a consumer free of charge, correct inaccurate personal information, or delete a consumerโs personal information, based on the consumerโs request, within 45 days of receiving a verifiable consumer request from the consumer, as required by Section 1798.130.202012_a_2 of the legal code. Although the policy mentions that the company will respond to a verifiable consumer request within 30 days, it does not explicitly state that it will correct inaccurate information or delete a consumer's personal information based on the consumer's request.

3. The policy does not clearly state that the company will update its online privacy policy or policies at least once every 12 months, as required by Section 1798.130.202012_a_3_B_iii_5 of the legal code. This is a minor omission and should be addressed to ensure full compliance.

4. The policy does not clearly state that the company will comply with the California Electronic Communications Privacy Act pursuant to Chapter 3.6 (commencing with Section 1546) of Title 12 of Part 2 of the Penal Code, as required by Section CIV1798.105.20205_d_5 of the legal code. This is a minor omission and should be addressed to ensure full compliance."",
