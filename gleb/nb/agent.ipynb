      "1. **Methods for Submitting Requests**: The policy mentions that consumers can submit verifiable consumer requests via email. However, the law (Section 1798.130 (a)(1)(A)) requires businesses to provide two or more designated methods for submitting such requests. This could include a toll-free telephone number or a website form, in addition to the email address already provided. \n",

While this is not a violation since it's shorter than the 45 days required by the law (Section 1798.130 (a)(2)(A)), the policy should mention the possibility of an extension by an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary.\n",

      "3. **Disclosure of Information Beyond 12 Months**: The policy does not mention the possibility of a consumer requesting information beyond the 12-month period (Section 1798.130 (a)(2)(B)). While the business is not required to provide this information unless it's feasible and doesn't involve a disproportionate effort, this provision should be included in the policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Exemptions**: The policy outlines several exceptions under which the company may deny a consumer's deletion request. However, it does not mention the possibility of a law enforcement agency directing the company not to delete a consumer's personal information during an investigation (Section 1798.145 (a)(2)). Although this is a specific scenario, it may be worth including in the policy for completeness.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Authentication of the Consumer**: The policy does not explicitly state that the company may require authentication of the consumer that is reasonable in light of the nature of the personal information requested (Section 1798.130 (a)(2)(A)). This should be clarified in the policy.\n",

The policy does not specify two or more designated methods for submitting requests for information or deletion. The law requires at least two methods, including a toll-free telephone number, unless the business operates exclusively online and has a direct relationship with the consumer.

Although the policy mentions a 30-day response time, which is within the legal limit, it does not explicitly state that the business will take the necessary actions within this time frame.\n\n3. The policy does not mention the possibility of extending the 45-day period by an additional 45 days when reasonably necessary, as required by the law.\n\n4. The policy does not explicitly state that the business will not require the consumer to create an account in order to make a verifiable consumer request.\n\n5. The policy does not mention the requirement to disclose the required information for the 12-month period preceding the business’ receipt of the verifiable consumer request, or the possibility of a consumer requesting information beyond this period under certain conditions.\n\n6.

If the company operates exclusively online and has a direct relationship with a consumer, it should provide an email address for submitting these requests.\n",

The policy does not mention the requirement to disclose and deliver the required information to a consumer free of charge, correct inaccurate personal information, or delete a consumer’s personal information, based on the consumer’s request, within 45 days of receiving a verifiable consumer request from the consumer as required by Section 1798.130(a)(2) of the new law.\n",
