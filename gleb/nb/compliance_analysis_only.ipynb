According to the new law, sensitive personal information includes details like social security number, driver's license number, passport number, account log-in, financial account, debit card, or credit card number in combination with any required security or access code, password, or credentials allowing access to an account, precise geolocation, racial or ethnic origin, religious or philosophical beliefs, or union membership, contents of a consumer’s mail, email, and text messages unless the business is the intended recipient of the communication, a consumer’s genetic data, the processing of biometric information for the purpose of uniquely identifying a consumer, personal information collected and analyzed concerning a consumer’s health, and personal information collected and analyzed concerning a consumer’s sex life or sexual orientation.\n",

The new law requires businesses to disclose the length of time they intend to retain each category of personal information or the criteria used to determine that period.\n",

      "3. The policy does not provide a clear and easy way for consumers to submit a request or direction under the new law. The new law requires businesses to provide a mailing address, email address, internet web page, internet web portal, toll-free telephone number, or other applicable contact information for consumers to submit a request or direction.\n",

      "4. The policy does not clearly state that the company does not sell or share sensitive personal information. The new law requires businesses to disclose whether they sell or share sensitive personal information.\n",

      "5. The policy does not provide a clear definition of what constitutes \"personal information\". The new law provides a detailed definition of personal information, which includes identifiers such as a real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifier, online identifier, Internet Protocol address, email address, account name, social security number, driver’s license number, passport number, or other similar identifiers.\n",
