      "In summary, the overall assessment reveals that the company's policy fails to fully comply with the new law in multiple sections. Here are the main issues that need immediate attention:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. The policy does not specify two or more designated methods for consumers to submit requests for information disclosure, deletion, or correction. This is a clear violation of Section 1798.130 (a)(1) of the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. \n",
      "\n",
      "2. The policy does not provide proper guidance to consumers regarding their rights under this title (Section 1798.185 (e) and lacks a mechanism for businesses operating in California to voluntarily certify their compliance with this title (Section 1798.185 (j)).\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The policy does not specify the length of time the business intends to retain each category of personal information, as required by Section 1798.100 (3) and does not provide a clear mechanism for consumers to delete their personal information as required by Section 1798.105.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. The policy does not clearly state how the company responds to access requests, including providing meaningful information about the logic involved in decision-making processes, as required by the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The policy does not provide a clear opt-out mechanism for the use of cookies, which is required by the law (Source: 58-pl).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The policy does not mention any measures to cooperate with law enforcement agencies concerning conduct or activity that the business reasonably and in good faith believes may violate federal, state, or local law, as required by Section 1798.145 of the new law.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. The policy does not provide a clear and company-specific opt-out mechanism, which obscures any part of the web page the consumer intended to visit from full view or that interferes with or impedes in any way the consumerâs experience visiting or browsing the web page or website the consumer intended to visit (Source: 58-pl).\n",
      "\n",
      "8. The policy does not mention any measures to cooperate with a government agency request for emergency access to a consumerâs personal information if a natural person is at risk or danger of death or serious physical injury, as required by Section 1798.145 of the new law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, while some sections of the policy are in compliance with the new laws, there are significant areas of non-compliance that need to be addressed promptly to avoid potential legal repercussions.\n"
