Meta, one of the largest technology companies in the world and the leading \\nprovider of virtual reality (“VR”) devices and applications (“apps”) in the United States, seeks to \\nacquire Within, a software company that develops apps for VR devices, including the highly \\npopular and rapidly growing fitness app “Supernatural.” If consummated, the Proposed \\n\\n1 \\n\\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION | OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY | FILED 10/12/2022 | Document No. 605823 | PAGE Page 5 of 23 * PUBLIC *;  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n         \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n        \\n             \\n \\n        \\n           \\n \\n             \\n \\n        \\n              \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n             \\n \\n             \\n \\n \\n     \\n   \\n   \\n     \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n\\x0cPUBLIC \\n\\nAcquisition would substantially lessen competition, or tend to create a monopoly, in the relevant \\nmarket for VR dedicated fitness apps. That lessening of rivalry may yield multiple harmful \\noutcomes, including less innovation, lower quality, higher prices, less incentive to attract and \\nkeep employees, and less consumer choice. \\n\\n2.  A global technology behemoth, Meta reaches into every corner of the world \\n\\nthrough its “Family of Apps”—Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp—with more \\nthan three billion regular users. Seeking to expand its empire even further, Meta in recent years \\nhas set its sights on building, and ultimately controlling, a VR “metaverse.” One need look no \\nfurther than the rebranding of the company from Facebook to “Meta” in 2021 to understand its \\nvision—and its priorities—for the future. And Meta is serious about its goals: it has become the \\nlargest provider of VR devices and apps to customers in the United States. \\n\\n3.  Meta’s campaign to conquer VR began in 2014 when it acquired Oculus VR, Inc., \\n\\na VR headset manufacturer. Since then, Meta’s VR headsets have become the cornerstone of its \\ngrowth in the VR space: its current generation headset, the Meta Quest 2, is by far the most \\nwidely used VR headset today, with a significant majority of headset sales in 2021 and 2022. \\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has publicly stated that Meta subsidizes its VR devices or sells \\nthem at cost in order to attract users.  One day before a complaint was filed in federal court to \\npreliminarily enjoin the Proposed Acquisition, Meta announced that it was raising the price of all \\nnew Quest 2 headsets by $100. \\n\\n4.  And Meta’s Quest Store (formerly Oculus Store) has become the leading \\ndistribution platform for VR software apps in the United States, connecting app developers and \\nVR users in an online marketplace through which developers can offer their products to users for \\ndownload onto their individual VR devices. Meta controls the wildly popular app Beat Saber, \\nwhich it acquired by purchasing Beat Games in November 2019. Beat Saber { \\n\\n} Along with Meta’s recent announcement that it was increasing \\nheadset prices, it also announced that, for a limited time, every new headset purchase will \\ninclude an offer to download Beat Saber without paying any separate download fees. In addition \\nto Beat Games, Meta owns a number of other VR apps, some of which it developed in-house but \\nmost of which it acquired by rolling up other app studios.  \\n\\nAlong with Meta’s recent announcement that it was increasing Quest 2 headset prices, it also \\nannounced that for a limited time, every new headset purchase will include an offer to download \\nBeat Saber without paying a separate download fee. \\n\\n5.  Meta has thus become a key player at each level of the VR ecosystem: in \\n\\nhardware with its Meta Quest 2 headset, in app distribution with the Quest Store, and in apps \\nwith Beat Saber and several other popular titles. This is not by accident; Meta has an explicit \\nstrategy of harnessing strong network effects in VR to ensure its leading status in this growing \\nindustry. Meta could have chosen to try to compete with Within on the merits; instead, Meta \\n{ {decided it preferred to simply buy the  } in a vitally important,  } \\ncategory. \\n\\n2 \\n\\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION | OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY | FILED 10/12/2022 | Document No. 605823 | PAGE Page 6 of 23 * PUBLIC *;  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n     \\n \\n     \\n \\n       \\n \\n\\x0cPUBLIC \\n\\n6.  As Meta fully recognizes, network effects on a digital platform can cause the \\nplatform to become more powerful—and its rivals weaker and less able to seriously compete—as \\nit gains more users, content, and developers. The acquisition of new users, content, and \\ndevelopers each feed into one another, creating a self-reinforcing cycle that entrenches the \\ncompany’s early lead. This market dynamic can spur companies to compete harder in beneficial \\nways by, for example, adding useful product features or hiring additional employees. But it can \\nalso make anticompetitive strategies more attractive. \\n\\n7.  Meta seeks to exploit the network-effects dynamic in VR. Indeed, Mr. Zuckerberg \\nhas made clear that his aspiration for the VR space is control of the entire ecosystem. As early as \\n2015, Mr. Zuckerberg instructed key Facebook executives that his vision for “the next wave of \\ncomputing” was control of apps and the platform on which those apps were distributed, making \\nclear in an internal email to key Facebook executives that a key part of this strategy was for his \\ncompany to be “completely ubiquitous in killer apps”—i.e., in significant VR apps that prove the \\nvalue of the technology. In that same email, Mr. Zuckerberg told his executives that Facebook \\nshould “us[e] acquisitions opportunistically.” \\n\\n8.  The proposed acquisition of Within would be one more step along that path \\ntoward dominance. According to Within’s co-founder and CEO, “Fitness is the killer use case for \\nVR.” But instead of choosing to compete on the merits through its own VR dedicated fitness app, \\nMeta has resorted to proposing this unlawful acquisition. \\n\\n9.  If Meta is able to proceed with the Proposed Acquisition, the merger poses a \\nreasonable likelihood of substantially lessening competition in the market for VR dedicated \\nfitness apps, where Supernatural { \\n\\n}. \\n\\n10.  }, Meta would no longer \\n\\nHaving simply bought up the { \\n\\nhave any incentive to develop its own competing app from scratch, add new features to Beat \\nSaber or other existing Meta apps to compete with Supernatural on the merits, or acquire a small \\ngeneralist studio that could supplement Meta’s considerable existing resources and VR know-\\nhow to develop an app to compete with Supernatural. Instead of adding a significant new rival to \\nthe mix, the Acquisition would simply let Meta assume total control of the { \\novernight. That lessening of competition violates the antitrust laws. \\n\\n} \\n\\n11.  Moreover, a company poised on the edge of a market may exert competitive \\npressure on existing participants. Regardless of whether such a company actually intends to \\nenter, the possibility that it may do so can spur other companies already in the market to \\nproactively ramp up their own competitive efforts. Meta, poised on the edge of the VR dedicated \\nfitness app market with its popular Beat Saber app, and with all its vast resources and unique \\nstrategic advantages, exerts such an influence. That pressure spurs the market leader, Within, to \\nadd new features, retain employees, continue innovating, and generally compete harder in order \\nto stay a step ahead of Meta in the event it decides to enter. The Proposed Acquisition would \\neliminate that incentive for market participants to compete, again in contravention of the antitrust \\nlaws. \\n\\n12.  Accordingly, the Proposed Acquisition poses a reasonable probability of \\neliminating competition.

Respondents and each of their relevant operating entities and subsidiaries are, and \\nat all relevant times have been, engaged in activities affecting “commerce” as defined in Section \\n4 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. § 44, and Section 1 of the Clayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 12. \\n\\n16.  The Proposed Transaction constitutes a transaction subject to Section 7 of the \\n\\nClayton Act, 15 U.S.C. § 18. \\n\\nRESPONDENTS AND PROPOSED ACQUISITION \\n\\n17.  Respondent Meta is a publicly traded company organized under the laws of \\n\\nDelaware with headquarters in Menlo Park, California. Meta develops and sells VR and other \\nextended reality hardware and software through its “Reality Labs” division. Reality Labs has \\nbeen growing at breakneck speed: it generated revenues of $2.274 billion in 2021, which \\nreflected a 127% jump from 2019 and a 100% increase since 2020. Meta’s best-selling VR \\nhardware product to date is the Meta Quest 2, while its best-selling VR software product is the \\nwildly popular Beat Saber, which was initially released by Beat Games, a studio that Meta \\nacquired in 2019. Meta continues to add new downloadable content to Beat Saber; for example, \\nit recently added a “Lady Gaga Music Pack” available for a $12.99 add-on fee. \\n\\n18.  Respondent Mark Zuckerberg is the founder, Chairman, CEO, and controlling \\n\\nshareholder of Respondent Meta. Mark Zuckerberg is the Ultimate Parent Entity of and \\nultimately controls Respondent Meta. His offices are located at 1601 Willow Road, Menlo Park, \\nCalifornia, 94025. \\n\\n19.  Respondent Within is a privately held virtual and augmented reality company \\norganized under the laws of Delaware with headquarters—and its principal business—in Los \\nAngeles, California. Founded by Chris Milk and Aaron Koblin, Within’s flagship product is \\nSupernatural, a VR subscription fitness service. Supernatural offers over 800 fully immersive VR \\nworkouts, each set to music and located in a virtual setting like the Galapagos Islands or the \\nGreat Wall of China. Through deals with major music studios, Supernatural continues to grow its \\ncatalog, which includes songs from A-list artists like Katy Perry, Imagine Dragons, Lady Gaga, \\nand Coldplay. Supernatural’s workouts are fitness classes that customers can access by paying a \\nmonthly subscription fee of $18.99, or a yearly subscription fee of $179.99.

The VR industry is currently characterized by a high degree of innovation and \\ngrowth. Global sales are predicted to more than double in just three years, from $5 billion in \\n2021 to more than $12 billion in 2024. \\n\\n22.  Users typically engage with the VR experience through a headset with displays in \\n\\nfront of each eye to place a user in a fully rendered, three-dimensional environment. Cutting-\\nedge VR technology creates an immersive digital experience like no other. VR users can \\ninstantly be transported anywhere in the world, backward or forward in time, into outer space or \\nfictional lands—all from the comfort and safety of their own homes. Unlike a game, video, or \\napp on a tablet, phone, or monitor, the three-dimensional VR environment creates the perception \\nof completely surrounding the user, allowing the user to move around in the projected space. As \\nMark Zuckerberg explains, “you’re right there with another person or in another place and that’s \\nvery different from every experience of technology that we’ve had before. . . .” \\n\\n23.  Meta’s Quest 2 is the best-selling VR headset and has been since shortly after its \\nlaunch in 2020. In 2020, Meta shipped more than 62% of all VR headsets sold worldwide. That \\npercentage surged to 78% in 2021, when industry sources estimate that Meta sold more than 8.7 \\nmillion Quest 2 headsets.  \\n\\n24.  The vast majority of users get apps for VR headsets from online app stores, which \\n\\ndistribute products for use on individual VR devices. Meta controls its own app store called the \\n“Meta Quest Store,” with more than 400 apps available for download. Meta also offers the “App \\nLab,” a Meta-produced tool that allows third-party developers to distribute apps not present in \\nthe Meta Quest Store directly to consumers. Other VR app stores include Valve’s Steam Store \\nand SideQuest, but the Meta Quest Store is the leading VR app store in the United States. \\n\\n25.  VR software and studio companies like Within develop the apps that run on VR \\n\\nheadsets. These apps run the gamut of genres from rhythm games to shooters to e-sports to \\ncreation and exploration and more. \\n\\n26.  {  } Meta’s Beat Saber, \\nan enormously popular rhythm game “where you slash the beats of adrenaline-pumping music as \\nthey fly towards you, surrounded by a futuristic world.” Meta acquired control of Beat Saber \\nthrough its purchase of Beat Games {  } in \\nNovember 2019. \\n\\n5 \\n\\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION | OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY | FILED 10/12/2022 | Document No. 605823 | PAGE Page 9 of 23 * PUBLIC *;  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n  \\n       \\n         \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n\\x0c27.  Since its acquisition of Beat Games, Meta has continued to acquire a series of \\n\\nstudios behind many popular VR apps, and now boasts one of the largest first-party VR content \\norganizations in the world: \\n\\nPUBLIC \\n\\na.  In January 2020, Meta acquired Sanzaru games, maker of the fantasy Viking \\n\\ncombat game Asgard’s Wrath. \\n\\nb.  In May 2020, Meta acquired Ready at Dawn Studios, maker of Lone Echo II, a \\nzero-gravity adventure game, and Echo VR, an online team-based sports game. \\n\\nc.  In April 2021, Meta acquired Downpour Interactive, maker of Onward, a team-\\n\\nbased first-person shooter. \\n\\nd.  In May 2021, Meta acquired BigBox VR, maker of Population One, a multiplayer \\n\\nfirst-person arena shooter. \\n\\ne.  In June 2021, Meta acquired Unit 2 Games, the maker of Crayta, a collaborative \\n\\nplatform that allows users to create and play their own games. \\n\\nf.  And, in November 2021, Meta acquired Twisted Pixel, a studio that makes \\n\\nvarious games, including Path of the Warrior (a fighting game), B-Team (a first-\\nperson shooter), and Wilson’s Heart (a mystery noir thriller game). \\n\\n28.  In addition to the aforementioned acquisitions, Meta has developed and released \\n\\nits own VR apps. These include: \\n\\na.  Horizon Worlds, a Massively Multiplayer Online game that allows users to build, \\n\\nshare, and interact in virtual worlds; \\n\\nb.  Horizon Workrooms, a productivity app that lets teams of people share their \\n\\ncomputer screens, collaborate on virtual whiteboards, and more; \\n\\nc.  Horizon Venues, a live-events app that lets users experience concerts, sporting \\n\\nevents, and more; and \\n\\nd.  Horizon Home, a social-space app that lets users hang out with their friends, \\n\\nwatch videos together, and join multiplayer VR games together. \\n\\n29.  Among VR apps, dedicated or deliberate fitness is { \\n\\n}. As Within’s co-founder and \\n\\nCEO puts it, \\n\\nplatform-level tools such as Oculus Move, a calorie and time counter that runs in \\n\\nthe background of other Quest apps and displays to users data about their activity levels while in \\nVR. { \\n\\n6 \\n\\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION | OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY | FILED 10/12/2022 | Document No. 605823 | PAGE Page 10 of 23 * PUBLIC *;  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n     \\n   \\n   \\n     \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPUBLIC \\n\\nTHE RELEVANT ANTITRUST MARKET \\n\\n30.  The Proposed Acquisition would substantially lessen competition or tend to create \\n\\na monopoly in the relevant antitrust market for VR dedicated fitness apps in the United States \\n(“VR Dedicated Fitness App market”). \\n\\nA.  The Relevant Product Market \\n\\n31.  The VR Dedicated Fitness App market is a relevant product market. The market \\nconsists of VR apps, like Within’s Supernatural app, that are designed so that users can exercise \\nthrough a structured physical workout in their own homes.  \\n\\n32. \\n\\n33.  Dedicated fitness apps offer distinct functionality when compared to other VR \\napps, apps, such as rhythm and active sports games, that provide an incidental fitness benefit \\n(“incidental fitness apps”). For example, they may feature adjusting difficulty so that users never \\n“fail” a workout; they may feature workouts designed by trainers or fitness experts; they are \\ndesigned to maximize exertion and physical movement for the purpose of exercise; and they may \\nfeature classes or other active coaching. \\n\\n34.  VR Fitness App market participants distinguish VR dedicated fitness apps from \\n\\nVR incidental fitness apps like rhythm and sports games that offer fitness benefits simply \\nbecause they require users to move and physically exert themselves while engaging with the app. \\nDedicated fitness apps typically entail a higher degree of physical exertion than incidental fitness \\napps. According to the Virtual Reality Institute of Health and Exercise, which rates energy \\nexpenditures during VR app usage, Within’s Supernatural currently has the highest energy \\nexpenditure, at 12–13 calories per minute.  \\n\\n35.  VR dedicated fitness apps are also typically offered using a distinct, subscription-\\nbased pricing model. Industry participants recognize that this is a distinguishing characteristic of \\ndedicated fitness VR apps when compared to other VR apps, including incidental fitness apps. \\n\\n36. \\n\\n37.  The VR Dedicated Fitness App market does not include other products that are \\nneither close substitutes for, nor offered under similar competitive conditions as, VR dedicated \\nfitness apps. For example, it does not include non-VR at-home smart fitness solutions, such as \\ndigitally connected exercise bikes, treadmills, weight machines, mobile phone apps, video \\ngames, or workout videos.  \\n\\n7 \\n\\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION | OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY | FILED 10/12/2022 | Document No. 605823 | PAGE Page 11 of 23 * PUBLIC *;  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n  \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPUBLIC \\n\\n38.  Functional, practical, technological, and price differences show that non-VR at-\\n\\nhome smart fitness solutions and at-home exercise products are distinct from VR dedicated \\nfitness apps.  \\n\\n39.  VR offers a level of immersion that other at-home fitness experiences do not, and \\n\\ncannot, offer. VR technology allows users to exercise from the comfort, privacy, and safety of \\nhome with the feeling and visuals of being somewhere else—atop a mountain, on a tropical \\nisland, in a futuristic world, virtually anywhere. The sensors in a VR headset and controllers also \\nallow for a degree of tracking, adjustment, and feedback that non-immersive exercise programs \\ncannot match. As Within’s co-founder and CEO explained, “[W]orking out in Supernatural feels \\nlike you’re a champion of a sport from the future. I love that and haven’t felt that sense of \\nathleticism ever on a treadmill or an exercise bike.” \\n\\n40.  There also tend to be substantial price differences between VR fitness and smart \\nat-home fitness products. Most smart at-home fitness solutions have much higher up-front costs \\nand much higher ongoing costs than current VR fitness apps. A Peloton smart bicycle, for \\nexample, costs over $1,000, with an additional $44 per month subscription cost, compared to the \\ncost of a $299 Meta Quest 2 plus $18.99 per month for Supernatural. It also weighs 135 pounds. \\n\\n41.  In addition to Supernatural, other apps in the VR Dedicated Fitness App market \\ninclude FitXR, Holofit from Holodia, VZFit from Virzoom, and Les Mills Body Combat from \\nOdders Lab. \\n\\n42.  { \\n\\n} Other than Supernatural and FitXR, { \\n\\nB.  The Relevant Geographic Market \\n\\n} \\n\\n43.  The relevant geographic market in which to analyze the competitive effects of the \\n\\nProposed Acquisition is the United States. While VR app suppliers may be located outside the \\nUnited States, customers in the relevant market affected by the Proposed Acquisition are located \\nin the United States. The availability of VR apps and headsets for consumers varies by country, \\nand VR consumers in the United States can only buy headsets and apps that are available in the \\nUnited States. Industry participants recognize the United States as a market. \\n\\nMARKET CONCENTRATION \\n\\n44.  The VR Dedicated Fitness App market is highly concentrated. \\n\\n45.  Market concentration within a properly defined relevant antitrust market is a \\n\\nuseful indicator of the competitive effects of a merger. The 2010 U.S. Department of Justice and \\nFederal Trade Commission Horizontal Merger Guidelines (“Merger Guidelines”) measure \\nmarket concentration using the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index (“HHI”). The Merger Guidelines \\noutline the principal analytical techniques, practices, and enforcement policy of the FTC and \\nDepartment of Justice with respect to mergers involving competitors. Though the Merger \\n\\n8 \\n\\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION | OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY | FILED 10/12/2022 | Document No. 605823 | PAGE Page 12 of 23 * PUBLIC *;  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n     \\n \\n       \\n \\n \\n \\n       \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n   \\n   \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n       \\n       \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPUBLIC \\n\\nGuidelines are not binding on the courts, courts frequently cite the Merger Guidelines as \\npersuasive authority. \\n\\n46.  The HHI for a given market is calculated by summing the squares of the \\nindividual firms’ market shares. HHIs range from 10,000 (in the case of a pure monopoly) to a \\nnumber approaching zero (in the case of an atomistic market). A market HHI above 2,500 is \\nclassified as highly concentrated. \\n\\n47.  If a merger combines two participants in a relevant market, thereby increasing the \\n\\nHHI by more than 200 points and resulting in a highly concentrated market, it is presumed to \\nenhance market power and is, therefore, presumptively unlawful. \\n\\n48.  The market for VR Dedicated Fitness Apps is highly concentrated, { \\n\\n49.  Supernatural \\n\\n50.  The VR Dedicated Fitness App market HHI has been well above the thresholds \\n\\nfor a market to be considered “concentrated” or “highly concentrated” under the Merger \\nGuidelines. \\n\\nEVIDENCE OF LIKELY ANTICOMPETITIVE EFFECTS \\n\\n51.  In addition to this presumption of illegality, additional evidence indicates that the \\n\\nProposed Acquisition may substantially lessen competition in the relevant market for VR \\ndedicated fitness apps. \\n\\n52.  The Proposed Acquisition would cause anticompetitive effects by eliminating \\npotential competition from Meta in the relevant market for VR dedicated fitness apps. These \\ninclude eliminating any probability that Meta would enter the market through alternative means \\nabsent the Proposed Acquisition, as well as eliminating the likely and actual beneficial influence \\non existing competition that results from Meta’s current position, poised on the edge of the \\nmarket. As the Merger Guidelines explain, “A merger between an incumbent and a potential \\nentrant can raise significant competitive concerns.” \\n\\n9 \\n\\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION | OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY | FILED 10/12/2022 | Document No. 605823 | PAGE Page 13 of 23 * PUBLIC *;  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPUBLIC \\n\\nA.  It Is Reasonably Probable That Meta Would Have Entered the VR Dedicated \\nFitness App Market Through Alternative Means Absent The Proposed \\nAcquisition \\n\\n53.  Meta has the economic characteristics, size, resources, capabilities, advantages, \\nand incentives to enter the VR Dedicated Fitness App market—and it has seriously considered \\ndoing so—by means other than this Proposed Acquisition. Meta could have chosen to build a VR \\ndedicated fitness app from scratch, add dedicated fitness functionality to an existing app, and/or \\nacquire a smaller studio that could support and supplement Meta’s existing strengths to facilitate \\nits entry.   \\n\\n54.  Consistent with its long-term strategy for its VR devices to become a widely used \\n\\nplatform that it ultimately will control, Meta has committed tens of billions of dollars to its \\nReality Labs division, which develops its VR and AR products, including more than $7.7 billion \\nin 2020, $12.4 billion in 2021, and $3.6 billion in the three-month period ending in March 2022. \\nMeta is already well on the way to realizing Mr. Zuckerberg’s goals of owning both the \\ndominant platform and the “killer apps” on that platform. Meta already produces the best-selling \\nVR headset in the United States by a wide margin. Meta’s Quest Store is the leading distribution \\nplatform of VR apps. And Meta is the leading seller of VR apps, with a portfolio that includes \\nBeat Saber, the market-leading VR fitness app, and Horizon Worlds, a massive social app that \\nfeatures its own game-creation tools for users. \\n\\n55.  Meta has the financial resources to develop a dedicated fitness app on its own— \\neither by creating a new app or by adding new features to an existing app such as Beat Saber. It \\nalso has more than enough resources to enter the market through acquiring a generalist studio \\nthat could supplement Meta’s formidable first-party studios group in developing a VR dedicated \\nfitness app. \\n\\n56.  In 2021, Meta had an annual profit of $46.7 billion, and spent more than $12 \\n\\nbillion on its Reality Labs division. \\n\\n57.  With its vast financial resources, Meta continues to add features and content to the \\n\\napps it has already released, and to develop and release new apps. Meta has also developed \\nmultiple full-featured VR apps in-house. What’s more, the {  } it proposes to spend \\non this acquisition \\n\\nWithin built Supernatural from the ground up into the {  } VR dedicated fitness app. \\n\\n During that time and on that budget, \\n\\n58.  Meta could build instead of buy within a reasonable period of time if it could not \\n\\nproceed with the Proposed Acquisition. Indeed, { \\n\\n} \\n\\n10 \\n\\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION | OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY | FILED 10/12/2022 | Document No. 605823 | PAGE Page 14 of 23 * PUBLIC *;  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n     \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n       \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n\\x0cPUBLIC \\n\\n59.  Meta has developed multiple VR apps from scratch before, including the \\n\\nambitious Horizon Worlds, which allows users to create and explore virtual worlds; Horizon \\nWorkrooms, an app that lets Meta test out new use-cases and platform-level features in the \\nemerging VR productivity category and allows users to connect and collaborate in real-time; the \\nHorizon Venues live-events app; and the Horizon Home social-space app.  \\n\\n60.  Meta has also developed and released Oculus Move, a platform-level fitness \\ntracker on the Oculus Quest that allows users to track active time and calories burned across \\napps.  \\n\\n61.  Through its string of prior acquisitions, Meta already owns seven of the most \\n\\nsuccessful VR development studios in the world, including Beat Games, the studio behind Beat \\nSaber. And, as of March 2021, Meta had nearly 10,000 employees housed within Reality Labs, \\nits division devoted to virtual reality.  \\n\\n62.  Meta’s control over the Quest platform also gives it unique access to VR user \\n\\ndata, which it uses to inform strategic decisions.  \\n\\n63.  In addition, Meta controls which VR apps appear and are featured in its Quest \\n\\nStore. This control guarantees that Meta could reach millions of existing VR users with a built-\\nfrom-scratch or expanded app through an especially important avenue for consumer discovery. \\n\\n64.  Meta—formerly known as “Facebook Inc.”—rebranded its entire business as \\n\\n“Meta” to reflect its focus on VR. Its brands, including Meta and Quest, are well-known to VR \\nusers. Meta also has substantial marketing experience as to a wide range of VR apps, including \\nBeat Saber, that it could leverage to enter the VR Dedicated Fitness App market. Indeed, users \\nalready associate Meta’s Beat Saber app with incidental fitness. This “name awareness” would \\nfacilitate Meta’s organic entry into the VR Dedicated Fitness App market, as a dedicated fitness-\\noriented version of Beat Saber would be in line with users’ understanding of the Beat Saber \\nbrand. \\n\\n65.

Thus, not surprisingly, after Meta’s acquisition of Beat Games and immediately \\n\\nprior to the launch of Supernatural, Beat Saber released a new track called “FitBeat,” which \\nincluded virtual “walls” or “obstacles” that users would have to dodge. { \\n\\n} Obstacles also appear on other tracks, forcing \\n\\nusers to duck and dodge, but they can be turned off. \\n\\n76. \\n\\ncome from all sides and a no-fail mode that allows users to complete tracks despite missing \\n\\nhas already included both a 360-degree mode where targets \\n\\n12 \\n\\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION | OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY | FILED 10/12/2022 | Document No. 605823 | PAGE Page 16 of 23 * PUBLIC *;  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n     \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n\\x0cblocks in recent updates—a feature that fitness-focused users can adopt to ensure an \\nuninterrupted workout. \\n\\nPUBLIC \\n\\n77.  { \\n\\n78. \\n\\n} \\n\\n79.  In fact, Meta’s internal codename for the proposed acquisition of Within was \\n\\n“Project Eden,” a reference to its belief that Apple was also interested in acquiring Within. \\n\\n80.  Meta also hired away the head of product for Supernatural at Within to work at \\n\\nMeta following the Supernatural launch. That individual’s portfolio at Meta included expanding \\nMeta’s presence into new verticals, including the VR fitness vertical. \\n\\n81. \\n\\n82. \\n\\n} \\n\\n83.  Accordingly, absent this anticompetitive Proposed Acquisition, there is a \\nreasonable probability that Meta would have exercised one of its other available options to enter \\nthe VR Dedicated Fitness App market. \\n\\nB.  It is Reasonably Probable That Alternative Entry by Meta Would \\n\\nSubstantially Deconcentrate the Market and Have Other Procompetitive \\nEffects \\n\\n84.  Meta’s entry into the VR Dedicated Fitness App market—whether by adding new \\nfeatures to one of its existing apps or developing a new VR dedicated fitness app from scratch— \\nwould have the effect of substantially deconcentrating and increasing competition in the market. \\n\\n85.  Building instead of buying would entail developing additional expertise, \\nundertaking product research and design, hiring more employees, and making other key \\n\\n13 \\n\\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION | OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY | FILED 10/12/2022 | Document No. 605823 | PAGE Page 17 of 23 * PUBLIC *;  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n    \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n  \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n       \\n \\n  \\n \\n\\x0cinvestments. Meta recognizes that building its own VR dedicated fitness app would require time, \\nadditional developer talent, and effort. But such efforts would reflect the very essence of \\ncompetition, the dynamic that the antitrust laws seek to protect and promote.  \\n\\n86.  Alternative entry by Meta would introduce a new competitor into the market with \\n\\nPUBLIC \\n\\nthe backing of one of the world’s largest, most well-resourced, and most experienced VR \\nindustry participants. Such entry would increase consumer choice, increase innovation, spur \\nadditional competition to attract the best employees, and yield a host of other competitive \\nbenefits. Crucially, it would \\n{the  } VR dedicated fitness app  }, Supernatural. \\n\\nalso maintain the independent presence and competitive vitality of \\n\\n{\\n\\n87.

Within Reasonably Perceived Meta as a Potential Entrant to the VR \\n\\nDedicated Fitness App Market \\n\\n88.  In light of Meta’s economic characteristics, size, resources, capabilities, \\nadvantages, and incentives, it would be eminently reasonable for a VR dedicated fitness app \\nmarket participant to perceive Meta as a potential entrant. \\n\\n89.  As explained in detail above, Meta is a massive, wealthy company with extensive \\ncontrol over and experience in various aspects of the VR industry. It has recently expanded into a \\nvariety of VR-related areas, including by acquiring the most popular VR incidental fitness app \\n(Beat Saber) and by internally developing a system-level fitness tracking tool that can run in the \\nbackground of other apps (Oculus Move). In a recent earnings report, Meta announced that it \\nanticipated spending some $10 billion across its Reality Labs division, which has found its \\nbiggest success to date with the Quest 2 Headset and Quest Store, and that it is committed to \\nincreasing those investments over the next several years. The VR dedicated fitness app market is \\nespecially attractive for a host of reasons, giving Meta a strong incentive to enter it. And Meta \\ninternally identified multiple means of entering the VR dedicated fitness app market. \\n\\n90. \\n\\n91.  { \\n\\n} \\n\\n92.  Meta also lured away Within’s head of product for Supernatural shortly after \\n\\nSupernatural’s launch. \\n\\n14 \\n\\nFEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION | OFFICE OF THE SECRETARY | FILED 10/12/2022 | Document No. 605823 | PAGE Page 18 of 23 * PUBLIC *;  \\n   \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n     \\n \\n    \\n \\n     \\n \\n \\n   \\n   \\n \\n    \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n   \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cD.

There are multiple barriers to entering or expanding in the relevant market, \\n\\nincluding time, network effects, ongoing development and content creation costs, post-launch \\nsupport, capital, brand recognition, and the need for consumers to be able to discover the app. \\nDeveloping a high-quality entrant also requires hiring the “talent needed to create true triple-A \\nVR experiences,” talent that Meta acknowledges is increasingly scarce. \\n\\n101.  To be sold on the Quest store, Meta itself must decide to approve an app through \\na technical review and a curation process by Meta that examines “quality, polish, entertainment, \\nvalue, and utility.” This can be a lengthy process and there is no guarantee any third-party app \\nwill ultimately be approved.  \\n\\n102.  No other company has the combination of resources, VR know-how, and control \\n\\nover the leading app store and the overall Quest VR experience that Meta has. \\n\\n103.  Once Meta—which also owns the Quest platform and app store—entrenches the \\n\\n{  } in VR dedicated fitness through the Proposed Acquisition, it will \\neffectively raise barriers to entry and expansion as other companies interested in the space will \\nunderstand that they need to compete with a deep-pocketed platform operator that owns the \\n{  } VR dedicated fitness app. \\n\\n104.
